Features
- Checkbox to hide some cohorts (or a way to base each state at zero so you can see how each state is growing/changing over time); maybe do this with clicking on the legend?
- Filter for group values by regex
- Filter cohorts by start/end
- Accept file upload or drag/drop of the CSV file
- Checkbox to show cumulative percentages in table (from top 0% to bottom 100% in the same order as the states right to left)
- Uncheck all group value boxes link

Bugs
- When some of the cohort days are missing, the graphs and animations act funny, showing the wrong legends
